                    Collections no longer load expansions, to help performance and load times for those with large collections.

                    Will now display the name & image of the specific version of a game you own. Apologies for the slow loading
                    of games, the BGG API has been very slow lately.

                    Sorry for the issues lately. There has been an ongoing problem with the BoardGameGeek API that other developers have also been reporting, where retrieving
                    game data is sometimes corrupt/incomplete. BoardGameGeek have also stated that they are limiting the API to 20 items, so loading game data will take a bit
                    longer now (we used to load 250 at a time). Hoping that only loading 20 games at a time will help with the issue.

                    Added the Year in Review feature. If you track your plays with BGG, you can view your stats for
                    the year. Available during December & January

                    We now store your collections for faster load times. If there is a change detected to your
                    collection, or if BGG is busy processing the request, we'll load the last saved version of your collection
                    while the update processes in the background.
